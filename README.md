This is a basic mobile application built using Expo, a development platform for React Native applications. The app's primary purpose is to display specific information in compliance with given constraints. The displayed content includes the developer's name ("Lakshmipathi"), their degree program ("MSCS"), and the school they attend ("cityu"). The user interface adheres to a set of constraints, such as presenting text messages on a yellow background, maintaining simplicity, and using only five React Native components (1 View and 3 Text components).

The code structure uses a functional component and a StyleSheet for styling in accordance with best practices for React Native development. The software can be launched once it has been performed on a variety of platforms, including iOS devices, Android hardware or emulators, and web browsers.  Overall, the "HelloWorld" mobile application provides as a basic illustration of how to build a React Native application using Expo, illustrative of essential ideas in mobile app development.
